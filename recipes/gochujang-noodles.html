    <h3>Noodles tossed with a gochujang sauce? Count me in! The gochujang sauce has a punchy heat to it while also being characterized by a silky, sauciness—both reasons why it is so craveable.</h3>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <h4>Serves 6</h4>

        <ul>
            <li>3 large zuchini, spiralized</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>8 ounces rice noodles, cooked according to package directions and drained</li>
            <li>1/4 cup Gochujang</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons hoisin sauce</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons fresh lime juice</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon minced fresh garlic</li>
            <li>1/2 cup water</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon cornstarch</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons toasted sesame oil</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
            <li>Sliced scallions and sesame seeds, optional</li>
        </ul>

     <h2>Steps</h2>   

        <ol>
            <li>Toss zucchini with salt in a strainer set over a bowl; let sit 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, whisk together gochujang, hoisin, lime juice, oil, and garlic.</li>
            <li>Cook rice noodles according to package directions; drain and transfer back to pot over medium heat. Pour gochujang sauce over noodles and cook 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Squeeze zucchini noodles to release excess liquid (when you think you’re done, squeeze a bit more), discard liquid and transfer zucchini noodles to pot with rice noodles and sauce and gently toss to combine.</li>
            <li>Whisk together water and cornstarch; pour into pan with noodles and cook until thickened and silky; about 1 minute. Off heat, stir in sesame oil and butter.</li>
            <li>Top with scallions and sesame seeds.</li>
        </ol>
